Basic Logging Functionality:

Scenario 1: Logging a message with INFO level.

Test Steps:
Call the log_message function with a sample message "User logged in" and "INFO" level.
Verify that the message is logged to the specified file "application.log" with the correct timestamp and log level.

Scenario 2: Logging a message with WARNING level.

Test Steps:
Call the log_message function with a sample message "Failed login attempt" and "WARNING" level.
Verify that the message is logged to the specified file "application.log" with the correct timestamp and log level.
Appending Logs:

Scenario: Logging multiple messages consecutively.

Test Steps:
Call the log_message function multiple times with different messages and levels.
Verify that all messages are logged sequentially in the "application.log" file without overwriting previous entries.
Check if each message has the correct timestamp and log level.
Error Handling:

Scenario 1: Invalid filename.

Test Steps:
Call the log_message function with an invalid filename (e.g., an empty string).
Verify that the function throws an error or handles the invalid filename gracefully without crashing the application.
Scenario 2: Missing message.

Test Steps:
Call the log_message function with an empty message.
Verify that the function throws an error or handles the missing message gracefully without crashing the application.
Scenario 3: Invalid log level.

Test Steps:
Call the log_message function with an invalid log level (e.g., "INVALID").
Verify that the function throws an error or handles the invalid log level gracefully without crashing the application.
